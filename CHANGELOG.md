## 3.2.0

* Added `GlitchText` - a slice/tear glitch effect. All characters stay visible and readable while a random, rotating subset glitches by tearing into horizontal slices that shear sideways: at most one word at a time in word mode, or a random group of 2-3 letters in letter mode, covering every segment once per forward pass and reshuffling on each repeat. Because the slices are disjoint bands, each glyph is drawn exactly once (no ghosting). Customizable via `GlitchStyle` (`shadows` toggles a chromatic tinted tear vs a monochrome one, plus the tint colors); the caller's `TextStyle` is preserved and the glitch loops continuously when `config.repeat` is enabled.
* Added `SquashBounceText` - a SplitText-inspired squash bounce. Each glyph drops, squashes vertically, and rotates, then elastically settles back to rest. The glyphs animate as a continuous traveling wave: each runs its full drop→squash→return over a wide window while start times are packed tightly, so many are mid-flight at slightly offset phases. Controller-driven (auto-plays on mount; honors repeat/reverse/pause). Customizable via `SquashBounceStyle` (`dropFraction`, `squashScaleY`, `rotateDegrees`, `squashPhase`, and `waveSpread` to tune how tight vs sequential the wave is); the caller's `TextStyle` is preserved.

## 3.1.0

* Added Swift Package Manager (SPM) support for iOS and macOS, alongside the existing CocoaPods podspecs.
* Declared macOS as a supported plugin platform.

## 3.0.1

- Improve README rendering on pub.dev.
- Fix image and GIF display issues.

## 3.0.0

* Added `GravityText` - a real 2D rigid-body physics effect (Box2D via `forge2d`): letters fall, collide, pile up on the floor between walls, carry linear + angular momentum, and push their neighbours. Tap to kick a letter or drag to throw it; play/pause/restart control the simulation
* Added `ScrambleText` - characters cycle through random glyphs then resolve left-to-right into the final text
* Added `RevealText` - text reveals behind a sliding cursor, transitioning each segment from dim to full opacity

## 2.0.0

* Added more custom controls over text animation & animation modes ( forward, repeat, reverse, repeat with reverse )
